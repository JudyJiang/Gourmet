      <title>Eating Up Italy</title>
      <url>[&quot;\nAmerica's love affair with Italian cuisine continues unabated, having cycled past the cheese-laden, red-sauce-driven, meatball-centric dishes of yore, on to regional specialties (from the Barolo braises of Piedmont to the tangy seafoods of Sardinia), and even back again ( meatballs  are hotter than ever!). So in this issue's  salute to the Boot , we take the long view, from Roman times to today.\n&quot;, '\nWe begin with an interview with Italian-American actor/director and recent cookbook author  Stanley Tucci . Unforgettable in the food-lovers\' films  Big Night  and  Julie &amp; Julia,  here Tucci revisits his earliest childhood food memory: the aroma of a rich rag\xc3\xb9 cooking on the stove on Sunday afternoons. The food-obsessed Tucci also shares vivid memories of the fabulous garden his grandmother tended and plucked from for big family meals, and offers his own surprising thoughts on what makes Italian food so loved around the world (it\'s one of the most popular cuisines Americans cook at home, according to &quot; What America Eats ,&quot; a survey conducted by our sibling site Epicurious). \n', '\nAnd since we all aspire to cook like our real and imagined Italian grandmothers, this issue is rich in authentic recipes, including three menus devoted to Italian regional cuisine:  A Taste of Umbria , a trio of dishes far more elevated than their fond, familiar American incarnations (panini, lasagna, cheesecake);  From Rome with Love , complete with tiramisu; and  A Tuscan Family Feast , inspired by Lucca and perfect for a fall night. \n', &quot;\nHistory, of course, has an important place at the table where  la cucina italiana  is concerned. In an  excerpt  from the forthcoming  Popes, Peasants, and Shepherds: Recipes and Lore From Rome and Lazio,  distinguished Italian food historian Oretta Zanini De Vita immerses us in the age-old traditions of olive farming and oil production in the Roman region. Two recipes\xe2\x80\x94Pasta e Ceci and Black Olives with Citrus Rind\xe2\x80\x94complete this journey through Lazio's groves. \n&quot;, &quot;\nWhile you're cooking up a storm, it's not too soon to start thinking about the upcoming holidays. Our brand-new  Gourmet   Holiday Special Edition  makes a great kitchen companion from Thanksgiving straight through to New Year's. Packed with 132 editor-endorsed recipes, it's on sale nationwide at Barnes &amp; Noble, Whole Foods, Hudson News, and other retailers. \n&quot;, &quot;\nWhat Italian dish do you like most?

      <title>My Inner Italy</title>
      <url>['\n 1959  I have just really started noticing the world around me, my neighborhood, my town, the sea in which I swim. I notice that no one minds where or what I read as long as I am not in my father\xe2\x80\x99s chair or my parents\xe2\x80\x99 bed, that my father\xe2\x80\x99s cigar smoking is something everyone complains about but no one can stop, that my grandmother is the smallest adult person I know and smells like her own kitchen (schmaltz, boiled chicken, rye bread, and schnapps) and my mother is tall and glamorous and smells like Ma Griffe, a cloud of sultry flowery scent that still gets my attention, 50 years later. In her wish to get away from the boiled chicken, boiled flanken, boiled potatoes (rolled in schmaltz, hold the parsley) of her parents, my mother embraced the time- and energy-saving foods of the New World. If there is a stronger word than  embrace , imagine it here. My mother was a mediocre cook, not only from lack of talent but also from a furious lack of inclination (as I came to understand). I remember one celebratory dinner of incinerated lamb chops, Stouffer\xe2\x80\x99s frozen corn souffl\xc3\xa9, Del Monte canned green beans with Durkee French onion rings crumbled on top, and a Sara Lee cheesecake, barely defrosted, with a couple of spoonfuls of Cool Whip ladled over it; that was as good as it got. My mother liked entertaining; she was brilliant with improvised hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres, charades, and fruity drinks\xe2\x80\x94she just hated housewifery\xe2\x80\x94and I think now, \xe2\x80\x9cWho can blame her?\xe2\x80\x9d\n', '\n 1960  I have been invited to Debbie Ruggiero\xe2\x80\x99s house, after Brownies. My life will never be the same. I behaved better than usual (played The Barbie Game without expressing contempt; played hide-and-seek without crying; resisted rummaging through the Ruggieros\xe2\x80\x99 bedroom, in search of unspeakable things), and I was invited to stay on for dinner. Wonderful things are happening in the kitchen. Sauce is bubbling. (You can hear it bubble. I have never heard sauce bubble in my life.) There is something in the oven that has the scent of cheese, which I recognize, and garlic and olive oil (neither of which I know). Mr. Ruggiero kisses his wife on the neck and says, \xe2\x80\x9cSmells good, honeybunch,\xe2\x80\x9d and she smiles and sticks a wooden spoon in the pot, and he takes a little taste and rolls his eyes, appreciatively. In just that moment, I have seen and heard six foreign and deeply desirable things, and then, still thinking about men and women and endearments and the bubbling sauce, I bow my head during grace (and when Mr. Ruggiero says that we are grateful for this food, I want to yell, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are so right,\xe2\x80\x9d but I just cross myself and say amen, like everyone else, and hope that the god of Jews will understand), and I eat spaghetti with a bolognese sauce, while a chunk of parmesan cheese is grated by whoever wants it, and garlic bread falls out of little tinfoil pockets onto each of our plates, next to a Caesar salad over which anchovies are draped like mermaids. Mr. Ruggiero has brought home cannoli in a box from an Italian bakery, and although they are delightful, with little candied cherries at their ends and powdered sugar all over, the truth is, they are not better than rugelach and lemon bars, and I decide not to convert. This meal is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me, including getting a pink bicycle for my birthday.\n', '\nI go to the Ruggieros\xe2\x80\x99 so often that Mrs. Ruggiero calls me her third daughter, and now that I\xe2\x80\x99m their third daughter, it makes sense to bring me to Mass on Sundays when I am staying for Sunday dinner. When everyone is dipping and kneeling, I dip and kneel, too, and most of the time I think, not about the blood of Jesus or the Blessed Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s heartache, but about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having Mrs. Ruggiero\xe2\x80\x99s lasagne, which is first-rate, although Mr. Ruggiero has confided in me that he finds it a little heavy and I have nodded judiciously, or Mama Ruggiero\xe2\x80\x99s   linguine with pesto trapanese , which keeps me coming over, even when Debbie becomes boy crazy and I do not. When the Ruggieros move away, I\xe2\x80\x99m eight years old, and I beg my mother to make Italian food. I describe the pasta and the pesto. I describe lasagne and veal roast with rosemary. I describe this stuff like a drunk locked out of his favorite bar, and my mother, who loves me, gives in. Our Italian dinner is Ronzoni spaghetti with meatballs that are half ground beef and half Progresso Italian Style Bread Crumbs and, brilliantly, a handful of Kraft Parmesan cheese, and it is all browned in A&amp;P olive oil. The sauce is Ragu and it bubbles. My mother makes a loaf of \xe2\x80\x9cItalian\xe2\x80\x9d bread (meaning, with a crust and not pre-sliced) and sprinkles it with more of the olive oil, garlic powder, dried oregano, and more cheese and puts it in the oven for a half hour. Our kitchen smells, if not like the Ruggieros\xe2\x80\x99 (which is like comparing a comic book to Monet), like something pleasant, like something that you would pause for. Our table is red with sauce, green with the Kraft can, and white with the linen napkins my mother likes. I ask for that meal at Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, and Passover, and my mother laughs and tells me to learn how to cook, and I do.\n', '\n 1962  I have been swimming for hours, wearing my new navy blue one-piece with the red vinyl anchor on one shoulder. I swim to the side of the pool and fall in love with Marcello Mastroianni. He\xe2\x80\x99s the guest of my parents\xe2\x80\x99 dear friends, who are in the movie business. Clouds blow past. Shafts of light fall upon il Signor Mastroianni, who is not quite 40 years old and so darkly handsome and loose-limbed and charmingly weary, but not too weary to splash me while he has a drink poolside. I suddenly understand why people like to kiss, why sitting in the company of another person is as thrilling as the Steeplechase at Coney Island, how watching a man pop a cracked green olive into his mouth and then lick his fingers could cause a person to be both breathless and uncomfortable. Il Signor Mastroianni brought out a plate of antipasti and we ate lunch under the patio umbrella, and in addition to discovering desire, I discovered roasted red peppers, soppressata, and marinated eggplant.\n', '\nMy mother picked me up, and I lay in the backseat, sighing, resting my face against the seat fabric and imagining it was il Signor Mastroianni\xe2\x80\x99s stubble. I went straight to my room and opened the encyclopedia to  I . I learned Italian so I could travel in Italy. I married a man named Ameche, whose family comes from a small town outside of Rome. I make chicken cacciatore for Passover and a version of Seven Fishes that includes my mother\xe2\x80\x99s  greatest hit .\n', '\nMy real Italy is like everyone\xe2\x80\x99s: Tuscany, the yews and views, yellows and browns, good red wine, beautiful figs, north to Venezia and its perfect, tottering beauty, and south to Sicily, to Catania and Siracusa and the ruins and the olives and lavender and the trees bent over to meet the ground\xe2\x80\x94all that. But my inner Italy is heaven on earth, it is always early June at the villa, the sauce bubbles, the dead and the living raise their glasses and the wild roses are everywhere.\n']</url>

      <title>Central Italy’s Infinitely Variable Recipe</title>
      <url>['\n\t\tMany claim that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to reproduce the food of the Central Italian countryside (I\xe2\x80\x99m talking Tuscany, Umbria, and Le Marche) without actually being there and having the foodstuffs of the region right in front of you. I beg to differ.\n\t', '\n\t\tWhenever I get tired of the grayness and frenetic pace of New York City, I go to my local farmers market and buy a pound of chicken livers to make Central Italy\xe2\x80\x99s most popular crostini topping. The livers are cheap as hell, and even at the farmers market, they cost less than four dollars a pound, a very sizeable quantity where livers are concerned. I grow fresh herbs in my kitchen window and always have some wine on hand\xe2\x80\x94the recipe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really call for much more. In fact, nearly any wine and any herb will do, since the other flavorings are only bit players when confronted with the loamy richness of the liver.\n\t', '\n\t\tIf I need inspiration, I consult one of the dozens of Italian cookbooks on my shelves.  Umbria Cooking  by Carlo Grassetti and Annalisa Breschi (Todi, Italy: Carlo Grassetti Editore, n.d.) suggests you use capers, sage, lemon, garlic, vinegar, and white wine; while Sandra Rosi\xe2\x80\x99s  Florence: The Art of Cookery  (Florence: Mandragora, 2001) recommends that carrots, onions, anchovies, white wine, and butter be deployed. As I said, these are all bit players in an infinitely flexible recipe, and nearly anything works: The result will be a deliciously livery and chunky brown topping that makes any meal or snack festive. It\xe2\x80\x99s guaranteed to lift you out of the gritty doldrums of American urbanization and deposit you\xe2\x80\x94for a half hour, at least\xe2\x80\x94in the sunny, sunflowered hills of the Central Italian countryside.\n\t', '\n\t\tWhat follows is the way I made my chicken-liver crostini today. I had some fresh rosemary on hand, but at the last moment, the savory on my windowsill produced a crop of little white flowers, and these, deposited on the hillock of liver that graces each toast, sent the recipe spinning in an even more delicious direction.\n\t', '\n\t\tFor the crostini:  \n\t\t1/2 baguette, cut diagonally into about 25 thin slices\n  \n\t\tOlive oil \n  \n\t\tSea salt\n  \n\t\tFreshly ground black pepper\n\t', '\n\t\tFor the liver:  \n1/2 cup olive oil\n  \n\t\t1 medium onion, finely chopped\n  \n\t\t1 pound chicken livers, roughly chopped\n  \n\t\t1/2 cup white wine, plus more if needed\n  \n\t\t2 tablespoons capers\n  \n\t\tFresh rosemary sprig\n  \n\t\t1/2 teaspoon salt\n  \n\t\t2 tablespoons of fortified wine or Limoncello\n  \n\t\tFresh savory sprigs, with white flowers\n\t', '\n\t\tPrepare the crostini:  Preheat the broiler. Dribble the baguette slices with olive oil, shake on salt, and grind on black pepper. Broil, watching carefully to prevent burning, until browned on the edges. Set aside to cool.\n\t', '\n\t\tPrepare the liver:  In a nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high for a couple of minutes. Add the onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until medium-brown. Add the chicken livers, and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Add the white wine, capers, rosemary, and salt, and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes, adding a little extra wine if the mixture becomes too dry. Add fortified wine or Limoncello, and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.\n\t', '\n\t\tPut the liver mixture in a food processor, and blend in three 2-second spurts. The mixture should be coarse, but not too coarse. Decant the liver mixture and put one heaping teaspoonful on each toast, and garnish with a flowered savory sprig. Serve immediately with a glass of Vino Nobile, Montepulciano d\xe2\x80\x99Abruzzo, or Rosso de Montefalco.\n\t']</url>

      <title>Letter from Terra Madre, Part 2: Italy’s Farmers Market Shortage</title>
      <url>['After the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you grow,\xe2\x80\x9d most conversations at Slow Food\xe2\x80\x99s  Terra Madre  conference this year came around to marketing. And it seems that at least on many levels, the U.S.\xe2\x80\x94the capital of capitalism\xe2\x80\x94is ahead of the game. As I talked with farmers from the Piemonte region of Italy, they all expressed fascination with American-style farmers markets, which are rare in their country.', 'This is surprising, since Europe is littered with open-air markets. Certainly they are regular features in many of the piazzas of Turin, with plenty of vendors selling local food. What is different is how these markets are set up and regulated. Though Italy has markets, it has fewer \xe2\x80\x9cfarmers markets\xe2\x80\x9d than we have in the U.S.', 'Instead of farmers selling their produce directly to customers, most markets, at least in Northern Italy, are filled with peddlers who buy produce from farmers at wholesale prices and then resell it in the piazzas. In addition to locally grown products, the peddlers also often sell items ranging from pineapples to Chinese-made sunglasses. In other words, many Italian outdoor markets are simply supermarkets on the street.', 'In the U.S., by contrast, farmers markets are first and foremost about farmers: The farmers take their own goods (or those of neighboring farmers) to market, where they interact with customers and answer questions about how their food was grown. And an increasing number of American markets have strict rules governing the distance that can be traveled from the farm.', 'There\xe2\x80\x99s a growing movement in Italy to bring in more American-style markets; at Terra Madre, the mayor of Turin said he wants to host some in his city. In many ways Slow Food has helped open up this desire in Italy by emphasizing the role of consumers as co-producers: It is no longer enough for us to simply buy food at a market; we must now build relationships with the farmers that grew the food, learn about how it was produced, and encourage good production practices. How else are we going to have food that is \xe2\x80\x9cgood, clean and fair?\xe2\x80\x9d']</url>

      <title>Italy’s German Accent</title>
      <url>['            Full\no\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 milk of human kindness\xe2\x80\x9d is how Shakespeare describes one of his leading\nmen, but it is a better description of Lou DiPalo. Lou is the proprietor and\ngenius loci of DiPalo\xe2\x80\x99s Fine Foods, a 97-year-old  latteria , or milk\nstore, that has grown into a cheese and Italian specialty foods shop (the\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s greatest in my opinion) on the corner of Mott and Grand streets, in\nwhat used to be Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Little Italy (but is now Chinatown). Lou\xe2\x80\x99s face is\nequal parts kindness, tiredness, and boyish animation. Milk is his lifeblood.\nOn occasion, when he looks pale and weary, after a night driving a delivery\ntruck and a long day spent behind the counter, I imagine that milk is actually\nrunning in his veins. It is whole milk from happy cows, unhomogenized, warm,\nfull of caseins (proteins essential to the production of cheese)\xe2\x80\x94and it is what\nkeeps him going, seven days a week, working the kinds of hours that would wear\nout somebody with mere hemoglobin to rely on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sell three hundred Italian\ncheeses,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou told me recently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe counted them one day, my brother and me,\nand when we were done we said, \xe2\x80\x98We are out of our minds.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d', '            Twelve\nyears ago, I moved into an apartment four blocks from DiPalo\xe2\x80\x99s and became a\nregular customer. Later, Lou and I became friends. I discovered that Lou likes\nto talk. He is fond of the soliloquy. He will explain what different cows were\neating and metabolizing when they were milked\xe2\x80\x94either spring flowers or intense\nfirst-growth summer grass or delicate autumnal second-growth grass or winter\nhay\xe2\x80\x94and how cheese can contain whole landscapes and traditions in its flavor,\ncolor, and texture. \xe2\x80\x9cI talk too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted recently, and I planned to\nprotest, but he decided to elaborate. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to taste everything. Before I\nsell it to you I have to share it with you. The shop\xe2\x80\x99s an extension of my home.\nThe counter is my dining room table.\xe2\x80\x9d ', '            DiPalo\xe2\x80\x99s\nis a warm, raucous, multigenerational family dining table. Lou\xe2\x80\x99s late father,\nSam, designed the store logo, which Lou describes as \xe2\x80\x9ca happy cow, giving a\nlittle wink. The mouth is a little squashed, but that\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed\nto be up against the window to give you a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a fantastical sort of\nplace. And Lou DiPalo is, in a way, a fictional character\xe2\x80\x94his real name is\nLuigi Santomauro, as was his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s. When the original Luigi, with his\nwife, Concetta, first opened the  latteria , there was already a\nSantomauro\xe2\x80\x99s on the block, so they put Concetta\xe2\x80\x99s maiden name on the sign\ninstead. DiPalo stuck, and Lou, like his father before him, still uses it\nprofessionally. Compromise became a culinary institution.', '            Last\nsummer, I asked Lou if he thought there was any part of Italy in need of\ndiscovery.', '            Without\nhesitation he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cTrentino-Alto Adige, in the very north. It\xe2\x80\x99s the bridge\nbetween the Mediterranean and Germanic and Austrian northern Europe. The people\nact like they\xe2\x80\x99re not Italians, but they love being Italian.\xe2\x80\x9d Coincidentally, my\nfavorite cheese is Crucolo, a semisoft cow\xe2\x80\x99s-milk product, riddled with holes\n(Lou calls this \xe2\x80\x9ceye formation\xe2\x80\x9d), that is made by a family in Trentino\xe2\x80\x99s\nValsugana Valley.', '            \xe2\x80\x9cDo\nyou mountain climb?\xe2\x80\x9d Lou asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to spend the night on a glacier? I\ncan put together some wine and cheese and  speck  people, suggest some\nunvisited places, maybe find you a mountain guide.\xe2\x80\x9d', '            He\nwas serious, I knew, but then he completely surprised me: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want, I could\ncome with you.\xe2\x80\x9d', '            Since\nLou\xe2\x80\x99s is a magical reality, everything fell into place. My wife, Daphne Beal,\nand our son, Owen, came along, and in the middle of July we met Lou in Merano,\na small town in the northern part of the region. Thirty minutes later we were\non a gondola heading up a mountain. It dropped us off in a pasture, where we\nfollowed hand-lettered signs pointing toward lunch. A path took us through high\nmeadows where the bells of brown and gray cows rang like wind chimes. There\nwere no fences. Walking right up close to these cows, Lou explained their bells\nin much the same way he explains cheese in his store: \xe2\x80\x9cThese are  bruno\nalpina  and  grigio alpina  cows, and their bells differ in size\naccording to their value and importance. The head cow, the one that leads all\nthe others up the mountain in the spring and back down in the autumn, will have\nthe largest and most elaborate bell and collar.\xe2\x80\x9d From then on, every time we\nspotted cows\xe2\x80\x94and they were everywhere\xe2\x80\x94Lou slowed down, hopefully, trying to\nspot the leader\xe2\x80\x99s bell. ', '            \xe2\x80\x9cAlto\nAdige,\xe2\x80\x9d like \xe2\x80\x9cLou DiPalo,\xe2\x80\x9d is an alias\xe2\x80\x94after World War I, just before Concetta\nand Luigi Santomauro were getting their  latteria  going on Mott Street,\nSouth Tyrol, then part of Austria, was ceded to Italy and renamed Alto Adige.\nMost locals speak German and call the region what it has always been called,\nS\xc3\xbcdtirol. All the towns in the area have Italian and German names on their\nsigns. Depending on how close you are to the border, the German name will come\nfirst.', '            After\nseeing cows and admiring their bells, we were hungry for cheese, so we visited\na man who describes himself as a \xe2\x80\x9ccheese caretaker.\xe2\x80\x9d Hansi Baumgartner ages and\nrefines cheeses in a Mussolini-era decommissioned bunker deep in the woods near\nthe Brenner Pass, and sells them in a beautiful store and tasting room in Varna\n(a.k.a. Vahrn). All the milk in Hansi\xe2\x80\x99s cow\xe2\x80\x99s-milk cheeses is raw and comes\nfrom the Pinzgau breed, which is brown with a white stripe down the back and\nproduces a small amount of milk with a high percentage of caseins. This is a\ncheese cow par excellence. ']</url>

      <title>Colman Andrews’s Favorite Restaurants in Italy</title>
      <url>['Ristorante del Cambio  (Piazza Carignano 2, Turin 011- 546-690) This historic restaurant (it was founded as a caff\xc3\xa9 in 1757) is simply beautiful, with its antique chandeliers, frescoed walls, and tall, arched mirrors. And the cooking\xe2\x80\x94classic with contemporary accents\xe2\x80\x94is immensely satisfying, from risotto with Barolo and agnolotti moistened with meat juices to sweetbreads with porcini and &quot;gran fritto misto alla piemontese,&quot; a mix of fried meats, offal, and vegetables.', &quot;Harry's Bar  (Calle Vallaresso, San Marco 1323, Venice; 0415-285-777) Sure, it's expensive and full of attitude, and sure, the food is uneven\xe2\x80\x94though the carpaccio (invented here), the tagliolini gratinati, and the torta alla zabaione never disappoint\xe2\x80\x94but it's Harry's, like no place else in the world.&quot;, &quot;Paolo &amp; Barbara  (Via Roma 47, Sanremo; 0184-531-653) With its superb modern Ligurian cuisine, imaginative but rooted in tradition, based on extraordinary seafood (the shrimp of Sanremo are especially famous), vegetables from the owners' own garden, wild game from the backcountry, and other impeccable products, it's one of the best restaurants in Italy by any reckoning.&quot;, 'Parizzi  (Strada della Repubblica 71, Parma; 0521-285-952) The traditional local cooking served in this pleasant dining room is spectacular (herb-filled tortelli, stuffed rabbit Parma-style) and there are always innovations (basil-flecked pasta with rag\xc3\xb9 of John Dory), but the real attractions here are the selection of cured meats, including a tasting plate of flawless prosciutto of three different ages, and the assortment of Parmigiano-Reggianos from different regions and of different ages.', &quot;Sabatini  (Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere 13, Rome; 065-812-026) Perfect bruschetta, spaghetti with clams, grilled scampi, and oxtail stewed Roman-style, among many other dishes, with urbane service and an intimate view of the goings-on in one of Europe's liveliest and prettiest squares\xe2\x80\x94Sabatini is Rome.&quot;]</url>

      <title>You Can Get a Bad Meal in Italy</title>
      <url>['The American Academy in Rome \xe2\x80\x94whose Prixe de Rome grants allow lucky scholars,\nartists, writers, and musicians to take up residence for 12 months amid the institution\xe2\x80\x99s idyllic architecture and gardens up on the Janiculum Hill\xe2\x80\x94has never been prized for its bleak institutional food, hardly what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect for your dream year in the Eternal City.

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy</title>
      <url>[&quot;It is difficult to avoid the skyrocketing prose of a travel pamphleteer in discussing this theatrically beautiful part of Italy. Everything about it\xe2\x80\x94the awe-inspiring scenery. the opportunities for fun and travel, the high quality of the hotels and the cooking, the picturesqueness of the architecture and folklore\xe2\x80\x94tempts one to employ the floweriest Thomas Cook vocabulary. What the Dolomites really need is a poet. These great jagged rocks leave the beholder breathless and bereft of adequate words. Sometimes they rise up ghostlike out of the mist, immense iridescent teeth bathed in lavender light. As the day wears on the colors change, and the rocks are alternately mauve and cinnamon brown, with overtones ranging from pink to ochre. Millions of years of erosion have created these grotesque denticulated shapes\xe2\x80\x94spires, caravans, camels' humps\xe2\x80\x94which take on an indescribable violet red at sunset.&quot;, 'Totally unlike the Swiss Alps in silhouette, the Dolomites resee them in one noteworthy respect; both offer exciting inducements to the traveler, the sportsman, and praise be, the visiting gourmet. It would take a column or two to list all of the mountain towns here that have comforted small hotels for skiers and summer people, and with palate cooking, too. The motorist and the cyclist find wonderfully fine roads to take them over the mountain passes, and if they wish to roost overnight amidst the crags, there are adequate summer hostelrics even in those lofty ravines.', 'The Dolomites, in short, offer extravagant inducements to many kinds of visitors, but on an economical plane. Incidentally they were named, oddly enough, for a Frenchman who spent a lifetime studying them. His name\xe2\x80\x94D\xc3\xa9odat Guy Silvain Tancr\xc3\xa8de Cratet de Dolomicu.', &quot;It seems necessary to endure a bit of geographical briefing to obtain a clear picture of the two regions discussed in the following pages. The far northeastern corner of Italy, a sprawling area which includes the denticulated Dolomites, the plains of Padua, and the lagoons of Venice, goes under the name of Venetia. Like Gaul, in that famous first sentence of Caesar, it is divided into three parts. One is Veneto, dominated by Venice and further brightened by such famous cities as Verona and Vicenza. The epicurean joys of Veneto were discussed in these pages in August, 1955. A glance at our little map will, we hope. show the other two parts clearly. One carries the rather heavy title of Trentino-Alto Adige, and runs to the Austrian holder. The other isn't easy to remember, either. It is Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and adjoins both Austria and Jugoslavia.&quot;, &quot;The extent to which Italy' frontiers have changed during the past two wars is demonstrated by both regions. The Italian flag flies over Trenrino-Alto Adige as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, which awarded this Tryolcan strip of Austria to her southern adversary in 1919. Friuli-Vcnczia Giulia, on the other hand, is cramped for elbow room on its eastern frontier because of territorial concessions made to Jugoslavia after World War II. Alto Adige is one of three autonomous regions under the Italian Repic. (Sicily and the Valley of Aosia are the other two.) You have the exhilarating feeling of visiting two countries for the price of One when you come here. The language, the architecture, and the food, to some extent, are Tyrolean, but you're still in Italy. In Friult-Venczia Giulia, however, one senses no international atmosphere. It' as Italian as polenta or  tagliatelli,  even in Trieste, whose boundaries were not settled until 1954. In the ensuing pages we will discuss the two regions separately, beginning with Trentino-Alto Adige and the cities where the pasting gourmet will find felicity.&quot;, &quot;Moist, fertile valleys and hillsides make this a land of plenty, teeming with fruit and vegetables. We drove for miles through verdant areas where fields were planted with a kind of succotash of corn and beans sowed in alternate rows. Strips ofossoming potato plants ran next to yellow bands of ripe grain, with apple, pear, apricot, and cherry trees between them. One field seemed to produce half-a-dozen crops at once. The vineyards offered another evidence of concentrated farming. The vines were trained on pergolas,ue-green with early summer spray, but the ground beneath wasn't idle. It was tapestried with potatoes, peas, corn, and string beans, Small wonder that this land bristles with canneries and jam factories. The famous house of Zuegg, well known exporters, puts up its celebrated candied fruit, preserves.  Macedonia,  and chestnut Cream in this abundant corner of Italy.&quot;, 'Tryolcan and Italian cookery live amicably side by side in the Upper Adige. Menus are printed in two languages, sometimes with rather cumbersome results. Baby  ravioli  become  Supfkrapfeln  and vermicelli in milk must be pronounced  Tscbottnudeln.  But  Wlirstel con Crauti  combines the best of both languages, and if you order it in Bolzano, you will have a  choucroute garnic  (to make this discourse truly multilingual) with magnificent sausages and smoked pork and sauerkraut. This is often served with  ravioli alla trentina,  which are stuffed with roasted and salted meat, chicken, onion, and parsley. And there is plenty of wonderful beer to accompany your feast!', 'Wild hare scamper over these wooded hills, and often appear on local tes as  lepre alla trontina,  a rich stew which needs only a little polenta and green salad to make a royal meal.', &quot;Polenta thrives here, as in the neighboring Vcneto provinces, but it is made from dark Saracen' grain, and is usually served with small birds or game. The conventional Italian  gnocchi h as here an interesting variation called  canderli.  These turn out to be dumplings made of flour, bread crumbs, milk, eggs, sausages, bacon, ham, and parsley. You eat them boiled ID a consomm\xc3\xa9 or dry with sauerkraut. Sound good?&quot;]</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy: Piedmont</title>
      <url>['It would be logical to assume that Piedmont, the corner of Italy closest to France and Switzerland, might share heavily in their tourist trade, and that it would be the first stopping point for wide-eyed travelers about to explore the Italian peninsula. This is so, to a limited extent. But it is amazing how many people skip Piedmont entirely in their headlong haste to visit Florence, Venice, and Rome. Such hurry is unseemly, to put it stuffily, and it is downright disgraceful in the case of anyone interested in mountains or skiing, in good provincial food and wines, or in the idyllic prospect of vacationing on the shores of an Italian lake. The uninformed passenger who crosses Piedmont at night on the Orient Express is missing something. We hope to prove it in the paragraphs which follow and to coax him off the train either at Stresa or at Turin. If he descends at the former, he is in the plushiest resort in the Italian Lakes. If he chooses Turin, he will find one of the most civilized of cities\xe2\x80\x94cheerful, clean, and urbane.', 'But the summer traveler with a car has the best of it in Piedmont. Crossing the Alps by the Simplon or through one of the St. Bernard passes over the mountain roads is a breath-taking experience. The beauty of the Alps captivates the motorist. The most magnificent mountains in Europe tower over him\xe2\x80\x94Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, Monte Rosa. He is suddenly in the Valley of Aosta, a highly individual corner of the Italian Republic where the people speak both French and Italian. The valley is dramatic and picturesque, spotted with storybook castles and unexpected waterfalls, It has many comforte hotels too, particularly in Courmayeur, Breuil, and St. Vincent. In summer they cater to the placid vacationer. In winter they are thronged with skiers.', 'It the highlights of Piedmont are the mountains, the lakes, and Turin itself, much more can be unearthed by an intrepid sight-seer\xe2\x80\x94towns such as Susa, R\xc3\xadvoli. and Chivasso, for example. There are wide stretches of Piedmont which arc dull and monotonous, we must admit; the wine country around Asti and Alba, for example, is uninspiring 10 the passing visitor. Yet it is in the realm of wine that Piedmont makes its greatest contribution to gastronomy, gourmets agree,', 'Barolo, the prince of Piedmont red wines, comes from Alba, whose vintages were praised by Caesar, Pliny, Henry II of France, and many another  bon vivant  in his time. It is a robust, generous wine, ideal with roasts and game. Its lovely ruby red turns to an equally fine russer as the wine ages, and it is clear to the last drop.', &quot;Barbarcsco is a slightly less forceful younger brother of Barolo, reseing it in every way except that it reaches full maturity at the age of three. Both are pressed from the ne Nebbiolo grape, which also is the source of Cattinara, Carema, Ghemme, and a few local wines that take this grape name\xe2\x80\x94Nebbiolo d'Alba, Nebbiolo di Custellinaldo, and others. Gringnolino, Freisa, and Dolcetto, the latter a red dessert wine, are other vintages worth trying.&quot;, 'Along with Barolo, Barbera is the outstanding pride of Piedmont. It comes from an immense territory in the Alba-Asti sector and varies somewhat in quality. At its best it is a soul-warming, sturdy red with a fresh, hearty bouquet \xe2\x80\x94 a cheerful companion for pasta or poultry. But a word of warning! There are two vastly differenr Barberas. The one which simates your spaghetti is Barbera  asciutto.  The other one is red but sweetish, highly fragrant but fizzy, and is called Barbera  amabile.  If you wish to avoid the disaster of having such a sweet \xe2\x80\x9c friendly\xe2\x80\x9d wine with your  bistecca alla fioreutina,  look for that word  \xe2\x80\x9c asciutto\xe2\x80\x9d  on the label and insist upon it!', &quot;The statistics are surprising, Red wines represent about nine-tenths of the Piedmont crop, yet the whites are famous, Asti Spumante is the most celebrated sparkling wine in Italy and is known throughout the world, Sometimes labeled Moscato Spumante, or Moscato di Canclli, it is a fixture for festivities, from baptisms to wakes. It is very low in alcoholic content, but its aroma makes your head swim. The sweeter sparkling Astis are the best known, but there are a few delecte dry ones. Cortesc might be called the Chis of Piedmont. It comes from Aless\xc3\xa1ndria, and is dry, fragrant, green-gold in color\xe2\x80\x94wonderful with Piedmont's lake trout.&quot;, &quot;On top of these viticultural accomplishments, Piedmont can claim the distinction of being the birthplace of vermouth. An ingenious citizen of Turin, Ani\xc3\xb2nio Benedetto Carpano, began it all back in 1786 when he experimented in combining the fragrant wine of Piedmont with aromatic essences and herbs. The name Carpano (the accent being on the first syllable) is still seen all over Italy, but there are other famous names springing from this region\xe2\x80\x94Cinzano, Martini &amp; Rossi, Gancia, and Cora, for example, which are household words among  bons vivants  the world over. Martini lovers owe Turin a little visit, we feel. They'll find the site of Signor Carpano's discovery right in the heart of the city. Of course, there arc plenty of other vermouths, from Tuscany and France in particular, but Torino did it first!&quot;]</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy</title>
      <url>[&quot;The charms of Lombardy, the industrial stronghold of Northern Italy, are rather variable. Along its Hat lower stretches, punctuated by factor)' chimneys and beribboned by sign-infested  autostrade,  Lombardy makes a somewhat hesitant appeal to the eager visitor. But immediately above this plain rise a series of ridge-like mountains framing one of the world' tourist treasures. the Italian lakes. Ac first sight. Lombardy is a blend of the brash and the beautiful. Few contrivances of man are as shattering as a busy traffic intersection in its capital, Milan, resounding with open cutouts and the staccato beat of Vespa scooters. Bur in contrast, hardly anything is as restful as a trip along the shores of Lake Como on a small, sleepy steamboat. But if the Italian lakes sell themselves on sight, the hidden fascination of the plain soon comes to light, especially for those civilized souls sensitive to music, painting, Romanesque architecture, and fine cooking. For all its buoyant commercialism. Milan has time to stop and enjoy the good things of life, as any visitor to La Scala can testify. Today' prosperity is reflected in resplendent shops, ultramodern hotels and a culinary standard which is a pure joy to the visiting voluptuary. Lombardy has earned a gastronomic rating as high as any in Italy, we think, not excepting the rich bounty of Bologna. So some pleasant paragraphs lie ahead.&quot;, 'One reason for this opulence is the immense fertility of the Lombardy plain, whose close-packed gardens, meadows, and orchards are moistened by an intricate network of canals. Fruit, vegetables, and cereals burgeon from this dull-looking land of abundance, which also provides a rich tapestry of green for a flourishing dairy industry. The cheeses of Lombardy-Gorgonzola, Bel Paese, and Stracchino all come from here-are known all over the world. And it goes without saying that a trout from Lake Garda or a veal cutlet  alla milanese  is invariably prepared in rich, golden butter.', &quot;The glittering cheese tray from this region deserves some elaboration, especially for those who may encounter it some day in a Milan restaurant. Bel Paese originated in the Lombard town of Melzo, and is now manufactured in other countries as well, including our own. The famous flat cylinder of soft, yellow Cream richness has imitators, of course, but retains its immense following. One worthy rival comes from the picturesque hill town of Lodi, and is called Fior d'Alpe. This flower of the Alps is a fragrant one indeed. Gorgonzola, first perfected in a town of the same name near Milan, is produced in many places along the plain, and many makers abroad copy it. The original savory, piquant cheese, its creamy color punctuated by green spots caused by the introduction of  Penicillium glaucum,  is incomparable at its peak of goodness. Less well known is a white Gorgonzola, somewhat sweeter and not so piquant, for less robust palates. Stracchino is a melt-in-your-mouth soft cheese, square shaped, which flourishes in autumn and winter. The most famous brand comes from the little town of Taleggio, and, when it is properly ripened, can hold its ground with the world' best. Sprinkled on the top of countless Lombard dishes is the local version of Parmesan, called Grana, which comes in a huge, husky, hundred-pound disk. Then there are white cream cheeses, Mascherone, Robiolina, and Robiola and a toothsome square one called Crescenza. We've tried them all, with entire felicity, and only hesitated before one called Caciocavallo. That name seemed to hide a horse, and we would have none of it.&quot;, 'If the cheese tray is imposing in Lombardy, the wine list, by contrast, is meager. There are no wines grown here to compare with the superlative Valpolicella of neighboring Verona or with the sturdy Barolo of next-door Piedmont, Bur some creditable vintages come from the slopes above the narrow Italian lakes, in this respect reminiscent of our own Finger Lakes in New York State. The wines of the Valtellina district on the slopes of Lake Garda will reward the explorer who seeks them out on a wine card. They are vivacious reds, pressed from the Nebbiolo grape, and they go under the names of Sassella, Inferno, and Grumello. Prom the vine-thick slopes south of Lake Iseo comes a limpid and subtle red wine called Franciacorta. It is pleasing, light, and fragrant. And there you have the highlights of Lombard wine.', 'The cookery of this bustling segment of Italy cannot be dismissed in such a debonair manner. The substantial fac is that a whole squad of famous Italian dishes originated here. Some of them are absolutely basic\xe2\x80\x94 risotto, minestrone, costoletta alla milanese, osso buco  and  panettone,  for example.', 'In Milan, the most opulent city in Italy, a rich repertory of regional dishes has won international acceptance. The classical, saffron-tinted, ambrosian favorite,  risotto alla milanese,  has conquered the most fastidious of French gourmets. The Milanese insist that their own version of  minestrone  is the first, and the best. It is  so good  that they eat it hot, cold, or lukewarm with equal gusto. Whoever coined the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cDreaded Veal Cutlet,\xe2\x80\x9d would be his blasphemous pun if he experienced a genuine thin, tender Milanese cutle of young veal, dipped in egg and finely sifted bread crumbs and cooked in rich Lombardy butter. It is as golden as an autumn leaf, and very simple to prepare. The tibia of Lombardy veal provides the ingredients for  osso buco,  one of the most original of stew dishes. The bones are sawed crosswise, with the mea and marrow clinging to them, and arc cooked for long hours until the meat is tender. Served with  risotto  and a  gremolada  sauce rich with lemon, garlic, rosemary, parsley, and sage, it is magnificent in its robustness and savor. The fame of  panettone  extends all over Italy. This large cake, resembling an over-grown brioche, is light and not too sweet, and made from the simplest ingredients\xe2\x80\x94flour, butter, egg yolk, sugar, candied fruit peel and raisins. Some Italian housewives make these great golden-brown mushrooms of goodness, but only for their families. Commercially, the market appears to be cornered by such huge bakeries as Motta and Alemagna, who produce it by the ton for the Christmas season, in sizes from medium to Gargantuan,']</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy</title>
      <url>['The spreading eastern hip of the thigh-high Italian boot is a rich and diverse land called Venecia. Bordering on three neighboring countries, and with a topography varying from Adriatic lagoons to the majesty of the Dolomites, it is far too complex to be compressed into a single region. Cartographers have simplified matters by dividing it into three Veneros, one mountainous, one coastal and controversial, dominated by Trieste, and the third flat but memorable, crowned with the most romantic jewel of Italy, Venice itself.', &quot;It is this latter area, subtitled Venero Euganea, which here consumes all our available space, and not surprisingly. It is as richly full of the good things of life as the proverbial fruitcake. In addition to the unique, incomparable Venice, the awed traveler finds three other famous Italian cities in this small area: Padua, site of a venerable university, Vicenza, shimmering center of Palladian architecture, and Romeo and Juliet's Verona.&quot;, &quot;In retrospect, St. Mark's and Tintoretto's fabulous murals may well outshine the epicurean phase of Veneto Euganea. Who has the impudence to speak of baby octopus fried in deep oil, or  polenta,  or  scampi,  when the Palace of the Doges still dazzles the eyes with its opalescent splendor and the spell of Veronese and Tiepolo and Titian remains unfaded? But impudent or not, impressionable people find it impossible not to indulge in reminiscences of Venetian food and wine. We find it difficult to don artistic blinders and hew straight to the gastronomic line in this charmed land, directing hardly a glance at a gondola or a Gothic  palazzo,  but that's what we've got to do. So we'll turn your artistic guardianship over to a chap named Ruskin and get down to Venetian fare, and where to find it in full flower. Although the keystone of Venetian cooking is the magnificent sea food of the upper Adriatic, its most celebrated dishes are founded on simple things, the lowly liver and onions, for example, or rice and peas. A skilled cook from Veneto transforms these into unsuspected delicacies, and we think you can do the same by following the recipes at the end of this story. But the basic treasure, Adriatic fish and shell fish, is less transportable. The impressive  scampi,  and their fragrant smaller cousins  gamberetti,  leave one groping for superlatives.  Calamaretti,  those succulent baby octopuses fried quickly in deep hot olive oil, and  bisato alla veneta,  an aromatic stewed eel, are two other specialties which make immediate converts. The subtle savor of sea food runs through rice and pasta dishes. A Venetian  risotto  may be studded with  scampi,  squid, cockles or mussels, and spaghetti is often ensconced in a gentle anchovy sauce. There are conventional fish too\xe2\x80\x94sole, mullet and the toothy dentex. The ever-present dried stockfish is transformed into a rarity in Vicenza. Stewed in milk with finely chopped onions, garlic, parsley, butter, oil. anchovy paste, cinnamon, pepper and salt, it becomes  baccal\xc3\xa0 alla vicentina,  a noble dish for ruddy, unprejudiced people. The hearty and unassuming  polenta  thrives more in Venecia than in other parts of Italy, and corn meal has rarely been put to better use.  Polenta e os\xc3\xa9i,  corn meal served with small, spit-roasted birds, will delight all but the too tender hearted. In the domain of wines, Venetia is one of the four outstanding regions in Italy, luxuriating in such noble names as Bardolino, Valpolicella and Soave. But this is another story, one which will be told by Frank Schoonmaker in a future issue of Gourmet.&quot;, &quot;There is much more to be said about epicurean resources, but the subject of dining in Venice just won't wait any longer. It is a pleasant ritual to contemplate, and there is no more auspicious place to discuss this delicate matter than a table at the CAFFE FLORIAN on the Piazza San Marco.&quot;, &quot;A landmark among the great caf\xc3\xa9s of the world, Florian still retains its ancient marbletopped tables which swivel as readily as a lazy Susan, its red velvet wall benches, and horse-hair chairs under its arcades. Elaborate gauche murals on its walls have been preserved under glass. On a rainy day (and there were plenty of them during our visit last April!) it is a providential retreat. The client&amp;$232;le is varied. There arc oblivious lovers, camera-laden tourists, lonely women, and businessmen scribbling figures on the tabletops. The waiters are quadrilingual but less attractive than the enormous brindle cat with a red ribbon around his neck who lounges about the place. Florian is essentially an open air caf\xc3\xa9 however, and when its vast acreage of tables is fully occupied on a holiday afternoon in summer, it is truly fabulous. Immense banners fly from three flagpoles, St. Mark's glistens with color and the Campanile towers over thousands of citizens congregated in the square.&quot;, &quot;If your time is limited and you don't wish to waste it over a protracted meal, Florian serves a quick lunch of sandwiches and pastry, with good coffee to go with them. They can even make a good dry Martini, something which generations of American travelers have requested.&quot;, &quot;Within a short stroll of this animated terrace are several pleasant prospects for the inquiring gourmet. Directly across the square is a rival caf\xc3\xa9, somewhat smaller, but distinguished by a smart little dining salon under its arcade and a siring quartet to add a touch of gaiety. It is called QUADRI and is a charming spot worth remembering. Behind you, occupying a choice local ion on the Grand dual,is HARRY'S BAR, a celebrated cultural center boasting the best mixed drinks in Venice, and a patronage top heavy with Anglo-Saxons. If you're homesick for the dulcet tones of American voices and in search of commendable food as well, Harry's Bar is a good, if somewhat expensive, solution.&quot;]</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy: Emilia-Romagna</title>
      <url>[&quot;Even the most enthusiastic Emilian press agent would hesitate to designate his two sprawling regions as among the most seductive in Italy. The upper half, which stretches almost entirely across the high calf of the Italian boot, is as flat as Iowa, and just as fertile. The southern half consists mainly of Apennine foothills, and is a bit forbidding, as any veteran of General Mark Clark's Italian forces will tell you. The famous Via Emilia, built by the Romans in the year 187, and running in an almost straight line for one hundred fifty miles from the Adriatic shore to Piacenza, is not an imposing highway today. It is beset with impacted road signs, clouds of dust and incessant repairs, and cluttered with the cacophony of sputtering scooters and motorcycles. Yet, by some peculiar justice, the Via Emilia is one of the most fascinating in Italy, due solely to the chain of medieval cities which it connects, and the monumental cuisine which thrives in them. From the Adriatic shore a string of significant names stretches almost to Milan\xe2\x80\x94Rimini, Cesena, Forli, Bologna, Modena, Parma and Piacenza, each famed in its way, each offering something unusual to the observant\xe2\x80\x94and hungry\xe2\x80\x94traveler.&quot;, 'This, to Italian epicures, is the cradle of the best food in Italy. They beam when they talk about  la cucina bolognese.  Bologna, the Eden of gastronomes, the city of fine cooking and keen brains! This is the land of those famous egg noodles with savory meat sauce, of the immortal  mortadella  sausage, of Parmesan cheese, and of turkey breasts sublimated with melted cheese and wafers of truffle!', 'The Bolognese are proud not only of their cooking bur of their robust appetites, and cite, as an example, a wedding feast held in 1475 when the bride and groom and a thousand guests sat down to table for three consecutive days, attacking such substantial fare as pasta, assorted roasts, sausages, hams, truffled turkeys, cheeses, fruits and pastries. All this was lubricated with the good wine of Montedonato and larded, one supposes, by judicious intervals of sleep.', 'Ingrassamento,  or fattening, is the word for Bolognese dishes in the minds of most epicures. The one lowering specialty, the key to everything, is called  sfoglia,  the basic homemade egg pasta which forms the foundation for any number of farinaceous dishes. Their names ripple along  fortallini, tagliatelle, lasagne, pappardelle, cappolletti, tortellini.  What musical names they are, and how gratifying to the gourmet! Each of them deserves a separate essay, truffled with tinkling adjectives! A rapturous Bolognese gourmet hit the proper poetic peak when he termed the tortellini the \xe2\x80\x9cumbilicus of Venus.\xe2\x80\x9d These incredible little circles of  sfoglia  are rolled around a stuffing composed of ham,  mortadella,  chopped veal, Parmesan cheese and a suspicion of nutmeg. When this tender delicacy is cooked in a good chicken broth and lightly sprinkled with Parmesan, it is no slight tribute to the goddess of love, 1 assure you.  Cappelletti  (little caps) are somewhat similar.  Tagliatelli  are famous throughout Italy-wide egg noodles with a delicate meat sauce.  Lasagne  are wider, thicker, inclined to be a little heavier, and are often tinted green from an increment of spinach, as are  pappardelle.  But it is useless to attempt to paint word pictures of these splendors. They must be tasted to be believed.', 'The porkers who snort about in their restricted backyards in Emilia are some of the noblest in Italy, and they end up in sublime disguises-the ample  mortadella  of Bologna, the hoofed  zampone  of Modena and a variety of succulent salami from Parma and Ferrara. Only one sausage is totally missing from local shops in this region the one we call Bologna. Nothing vaguely resembling it can be found anywhere. Yes, we have no Bologna in Bologna.  Mortadella  is its particular pride. As you know, it is different from other sausages-larger, wider, redder, more delicate in tasre, interspersed with white cubes of fat. Its origin dates back to the Middle Ages, and the monks may have been mixed up in its invention. At all events, old engravings show robed ecclesiastics happily pounding pork in a mortar while large sausages hang overhead.', 'The wines of this region are honest, hearty and acceptable, but they lack the luster of those from neighboring Tuscany and Veneio. The best wine lists feature these, but there are several local wines worth asking for. The best is Lambrusco, grown near Modena. The Albana Di Bertinoro and the Sangiovese will reward you well if you see them on a rural wine list.', &quot;In sketching out a gastronomically guided tour of Emilia Romagna, we are arbitrarily beginning on the Adriatic coast, where  you  may not be us all, and covering Romagna first. This puts Ravenna and Perrara at the head of our list. The savory path of interest then leads straight up the Via Emilia, ending in your own American kitchen with two Bolognese recipes which we implore you to try. Rimini and Cesenatico, on the Adriatic coast, have access to superlative sea food, but we haven't found the right restaurant in either of them-yet. So the first gourmet stop on the Via Emilia is Ravenna.&quot;]</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy: Umbria, The Marches and San Marino</title>
      <url>[&quot;We're not going to thrash around with superlatives in describing the two regions which have been paired together to form the sixth of these epicurean jaunts. They are not the most spectacular parts of Italy, and the traveler in the custody of a guided tour barely glimpses them. A pilgrimage to Assisi, the shrine of St. Francis, an overnight stop in Perugia, and he's off to Venice, with hardly a glance at the Republic of San Marino over his left shoulder, and only a flickering acquaintance with the seductive wine of Orvieto and the black truffles of Norcia. And that's too bad.&quot;, &quot;The more leisurely visitor, especially if he has a midget motorcar to putter about in, soon learns how much his hurried compatriot has missed. Umbria, and most of the Marches, is just one verdant Apennine after the other, with a wealth of medieval hill towns to reward the adventurer. By the time he has seen such miniature Carcassonnes as Spoleto, Cascia and Urbino, and has visited the fantastic crow's nest republic of San Marino, he realizes that this region is one of the neglected treasures of Italy. He may have found a dearth of fashionable spots for the skier, the casino hound and the sun worshiper, but he has encountered good food and wine, and comfortable places to slop overnight-almost everything, in fact, except his fellow tourist. This travelogue, therefore, is definitely for those who yearn to leave the beaten path.&quot;, &quot;There arc rewards aplenty for the food-conscious pilgrim too, although he must do a bit of scouting to avoid the dullness of hotel fare. Umbrian cooking has no strong regional tradition, but there are a few local dishes revolving around truffles, suckling pig and wild pigeons which are quite exciting. A rustling, gray-green tapestry of olive trees covers these Apennine slopes, which means that Umbrian cooking basks in olive oil, and of a quality only surpassed in Tuscany. In short, there is nothing sparse or Franciscan about 'he cooking in Umbria, in spite of the chaste example set by its greatest citizen, St. Francis of Assisi.&quot;, &quot;The Marches, unlike Umbria, are not landlocked and rejoice in the superlative fish caught off their Adriatic shore, the most delicate and varied in Italy. The fish soup which results from this piscatorial plenty is called  brodetto marchigiano,  an Adriatic cousin which holds up its head proudly with the  bouillabaisse  of Marseilles and the  zuppa di pesce  of Genoa. Here is a regional specialty to rank with the finest in Italy, a rash statement which we venture only after tasting b rodetto all' anconeiana  at Passetto, Ancona's most celebrated restaurant.&quot;, 'A fine race of oxen thrives in the hills around Perugia, assuring the robust steaks and savory ragouts which you will find on local menus. It is more difficult to come upon an Umbrian specially called  palombacce,  but if you are here in March or October, it is worth seeking out. During these months the wild pigeons fly over these hills, and a good many of them are waylaid to end up on the matting spit as  palombacce.  They arc served with an aromatic sauce called  la gbiotta,  based on a learned an\xc3\xa9 savory Combination of olives, lemon peel, sage, anchovy, vinegar, wine, oil, salt and pepper, quite enough to disguise the indiscriminate eating habits of  any  vagrant pigeon.', &quot;A favorite family dish in Umbria is  la porcbetta.  This is young, unfattened suckling pig. spiced with garlic, rosemary and other aromatic herbs. His eatable spare parts are cooked in a separate dish in the same oven. Whether they serve him with an appetizing black truffle in his mouth we don't know, but it sounds logical, for Umbria is the Italian home of the black truffle.&quot;, &quot;In the late autumn the Umbrian farmer and either his truffle hound or his sow are familiar sights in the southern extremity of this region. Norcia, Scheggino, Spoleto and Cascia, picturesque hill towns all (the last named provided our title page sketch), are centers for the fragrant ebony tuber which now plays such an important part in the orchestra of any fine chef. There are many other varieties of truffle in Italy, of course: delicious white and lavender ones, best known in Piedmont, and some which aren't delicacies at all. There is a strong, handsome but malodorous one called  tubero bituminato,  for example, a too-coalish nugget which even pigs won't eat, and which is blackballed from the big city markets. Hut luckily the choicest black varieties, tubero melanosporo  and tubero  brumale,  flourish in these hills, as they do under the oak trees in P\xc3\xa9rigord. In years when the truffle crop is sparse in France, it seems logical to import from Italy. After ail.  \xc3\xa9crevisses  are flown into France from Poland to garnish many a Burgundian dish. Just how many Umbrian tubers have been shipped to P\xc3\xa9rigord to become naturalized French truffles, and to appear imbedded in the divine  foie gras  of P\xc3\xa9rigord geese, is a matter of total conjecture. It h as  happened, however, and Italian black truffles have found a warm reception in New York and London restaurants as well. They found an even warmer reception two millennia ago when the Romans, ascribing aphrodisiac powers to them (\xe2\x80\x9cPbiltrum  quo vincere mulierem\xe2\x80\x9d),  dedicated the templing tuber to Venus herself' There is an ancient saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthose who wish to lead virtuous lives should abstain from truffles, but proof of such propensities, alas for the truffle trade, is dismally absent.&quot;]</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy</title>
      <url>['The migratory scribe whose primary interest is gastronomy will find that he has ample time for truant tangents in most of the Italian provinces. Beguiling as the theme of regional wine and cooking may be, he can still wander into the green pastures of history, art, and bicycle races without neglecting his epicurean duly. Not so in Rome. The subject of wining and dining in the Eternal City is so rich and so rewarding that vagrant deviations into the companion beauties of the capital are out of the question.', 'Unless he is to indulge in a full-length novelette, he must have the fortitude to forego the antique shops on the Via Sistina and the twinkling ankles on the Via Flaminia for the solid facts of life on the Via Gastronomia.', &quot;So, with nary a sidelong, time-consuming glance at St. Peter's or the Forum, we plunge headlong into the theme of Roman food-and come up bubbling with encouraging facts. The much quoted assertion that it is impossible to dine poorly in Rome turns out to be a glorious and gratifying truth. As do the Parisians and the Lyonnais, the Romans refuse to patronize a poor restaurant. You see one now and then tables deserted, waiters balancing forlornly on their heels, cash registers silent. A few doors away is another place absolutely choked with chattering, gregarious guests. The Roman public knows the difference, and so will the timid traveler-if he follows the crowd!&quot;, &quot;The excellence of Roman cooking runs through all categories of dining places, from the humble  trattoria  CO the chic casino in the park. It applies to discreet carpeted haunts of the aristocracy and noisy nightclub cellars ringing with song. Price seems to make little difference. You will find delectable Roman food in sidewalk cafes across the Tiber and in inexpensive country inns along the ancient Appian way. Only the drab and unimaginative diner who sticks close to his hotel and submits to \xe2\x80\x9cinternational\xe2\x80\x9d cooking should find it dull. Beyond any doubt Rome's gastronomic stature is in keeping with its historic eminence as a world capital-and that's good news.&quot;, &quot;The  carta del giorno  of any good Roman restaurant contains a tempting cross section of Italian cookery-Adriatic fish, Florentine beef. Bolognese pasta, Neapolitan sweets-but Rome's own specialties stand up well in comparison. Baby lamb, egg noodles and artichokes take on splendor and originality when prepared in the Roman manner, and no visiting gourmet worthy of the name would leave the city without making the seductive acquaintance of  fettuccine, abbacchio  and  carciofi alla romana.  Among many Roman dishes, we have space to dwell only upon a spectacular few.&quot;, &quot;Fettuccine alla romana:  These arc thin, fresh egg noodles, served very hot with butter and finely grated Parmesan cheese. This sounds like a banal definition for a sublime dish, and so it is This is a crowning achievement in pasta, and so perfected that few outsiders can hope to achieve it. Yet its essentials are simplicity itself. The mannered flush and flourish which accompany this famous dish at Alfredo's and elsewhere happen to be essential, even if a gold fork and spoon are nor. The beautiful ribbons of golden noodles arrive at your table quite dry, and as hot as live steam. In a half minute or so your ma\xc3\xaetre d'h\xc3\xb4tel must melt an imposing block of butter in them, together with just the right amount of Parmesan or Romano cheese-ground almost to the fineness of talcum powder. It takes a lot of lightning tossing, twirling and mixing to melt both butter and cheese, and to transfer the  fettuccine  still steaming to your plate. Apart from  cr\xc3\xaapes Suzette,  few dishes offer such a dazzling opportunity to a head waiter with exhibitionist tendencies.&quot;, &quot;Roman  fettuccine  is about three-eighths of an inch wide and much thinner than other egg-enriched Italian noodles, but the secret of its beauty seems to lie in its freshness. Made in the morning, and cooked only on order, the  maesto fettuccine al triplo burro  is a thing of rich, buttery, fattening splendor. Yet its price on a Roman menu is less than fifty cents. An  abbacchio  is a very young milk-fed lamb, not much bigger than a full grown hare when it is suspended in an Italian butcher shop. It can be roasted in the oven or on a spit, and is exquisitely tender and delicate. Cooked  alla cacciatore  in a casserole with peppers, garlic, rosemary, vinegar, spices and a suspicion of anchovy, it takes on a character all of its own. As a delicacy,  abbacchio  is totally satisfying except to the too-tender hearted. Of course, if you conjure up a picture of baby lambs frolicking among the bluebells and buttercups, you're not going to enjoy the dish as well. It is a shame to end their days even before their baas have changed.&quot;]</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy</title>
      <url>['Sicily signifies a great deal more to the traveler than a mere region of Italy, or the largest island in the Mediterranean with a disquieting emblem made up of a face surrounded by wings, serpents and three legs. It is a museum, an astonishing one, of diverse and unrelated civilizations-ancient Greek, Roman, Saracen and Norman, with smatterings of Spain thrown in, When the intrepid Garibaldi stormed the island less than a century ago and brought it into the newly founded Kingdom of Italy, he had annexed for his country an immense vineyard, an even larger orchard, a volatile, raven-haired, sun-browned population, and an absolute treasure of architecture and dramatic landscape.', 'But Sicily retains a mysterious atmosphere all its ownstrangely African, faintly Oriental. The Sicilians sing with a melancholy Moorish wail, and their villages are pervaded with the perfume of pungent Oriental spices. Their fishing vessels are rigged in slightly berserk fashion, with russet-orange sails, just as they are in Tunis or Cairo. Their swarthy complexions, luxuriant black hair and fine features suggest more than a few Moorish ancestors. They are not as gay as the Neapolitans, but have plenty of Italian virtues. The Sicilian farmers are hard workers, and have made valiant attempts to salvage every bit of arable soil on their island. The most uncompromising hills are terraced in the hope that they will provide a shelf where an olive tree or a few artichokes may take root. There is overpopulation in Sicily, and the poverty which goes with it. The Italian famiry for producing multinidinous progeny is never better illustrated than here. Bambini positively swarm. In other fields of activity, however, unemployment among the men runs high. The streets of mast Sicilian villages are crowded with them, all highly articulate, all gifted with flamboyant gestures. But the Sicilian  women  all seem to have something to do!', 'Sicily has been popular with foreign visitors for decades. Most of the pioneer travelers, in the early nineteenth century, were Englishmen-archaeologists who reveled in the remote temples of Segesta and Selinunre, and wine dealers who developed the sweet wines of Marsala into a formidable rival of port in the British market. By the turn of the present century the island had become established as  a  major objective for travelers, and so it remains today. Hotels were built or adapted to accommodate the tourist about then, and  they  remain the same also. There is a static charm to the hotel situation in Sicily. My venerable Baedeker dates from 1912, but its information about acceptable hostelrics is quite accurate today, except that full  pensions ii  no longer 20 lire per day. At present it costs more than that to mail a local letter or to buy an Italian newspaper.', &quot;The same few comfortable hotels in Messina, Syracuse, Agrigento and Palermo mentioned forty-two years ago are still the ones to recommend today. Taormina has blossomed out with a few new names, and there is one startling, ultramodern newcomer at Mondello, Palermo's beach resort, which deserves your attention. We have a firm conviction that today's traveler, unless he has had basic training in youth hostels or as an itinerant peddler, will not be happy in the lower categories of Sicilian hotels. Outside of Taormina, the charming exception to the rule, it is wise CO book the best.&quot;, 'Gastronomy plays fourth fiddle for the visitor in Sicily, and we might as well be candid about it. Conventional hotel food will be the lot of all but the most zealous seeker of local dishes. Sicilian specialties  do  exist, however, and the animated restaurants of Palermo will provide many of them. Rare is the tourist who can claim a first-hand knowledge of  pasta alle sarde,  probably the most celebrated Sicilian dish. It consists of boiled macaroni, in long strands, mixed with alternate layers of baby  fmoccbio  and young fresh sardines, both cooked in oil. This delicacy is served cold in pie-shaped portions, It tastes even better than it sounds!', 'Clean 1 pound of fresh sardines, discard the heads, tails, and backbones, and split the fish length wise. Roll the fish in flour, sprinkle with a little salt, and saute\xc3\xa9 them in a little olive oil until brown on both sides. Trim 1 pound of fennel, wash it thoroughly, and cook it in boiling salted water until tender. Drain, squeeze out the excess water, and chop the fennel finely. Wash the salt from 12 anchovy filets and cook them slowly in \xc2\xbc cup olive oil until they are almost dissolved. Add the chopped fennel, a pinch of salt and pepper, and cook slowly in the olive oil for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a little more olive oil if needed. Stir in \xc2\xbd cup tomato paste diluted in 1 cup hot water.']</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy: Campania</title>
      <url>[&quot;The opalescent splendor of the Bay of Naples is a subject which has tempted painters, poets, and mere pamphleteers for centuries. Guarded by two steep, romantic islands, Capri and Ischia, and dominated by the brown and lavender majesty of Vesuvius, this vivid crescent of water gives an impression of utter enchantment from the decks of an incoming steamer. Naples glistens in polychrome brightness beneath the frowning fortress of St. Elmo, its new apartments climbing audaciously up the cliffs. The impatient traveler can hardly wait to disembark. When he  does  set foot in this throbbing metropolis, the scene becomes less idyllic. He immediately becomes a choice plum for a cluster of vultures and multilingual smoothies whose only thoughts are concentrated on his pocketbook. The noise, the congestion, the confusion arc all intense. The close-range charm of Naples is far more reticent. Its treasures soon come to light, of course. Next morning the traveler visits the National Museum and sees priceless relics from Pompeii and Herculaneum, and that evening he goes to the San Carlo Opera House, scene of Caruso's early triumphs. He may be tempted by the aquarium, whose pink prima donna is a diaphanous fish with its own parasol, or by the San Martino cloisters, occupying a breath-taking eminence which almost floats over the close-packed housetops of the city.&quot;, 'But a fundamental fact soon becomes clear-the secret of Naples long popularity with travelers lies farther afield. The jewels of the Bay of Naples are embedded in the hills and along the rocky shore, and they are unique in the world today. There is nothing to approach Pompeii and Herculaneum. Few islands have the fascination of Capri. The Amalfi Drive remains an experience of total beauty, uncluttered by billboards. And Paestum, the setting for some of the most perfect Greek temples, can only be excelled by Athens itself. Taken not by its teeming self, but with its surrounding splendors, Naples becomes irresistible.', 'Of course there are inland points in the Campania region which merit exploration, particularly Casena and its royal palace. Built by the King of Naples in 1754, it is so vast that it served as a Pentagon for the combined Allied top brass in World War II. Then there is Benevento, setting of one of the most perfect of Roman arches and, more important to the gourmet, the home of Strega, the classic Italian liqueur. But most travelers to Campania stay close to the Bays of Naples and Salerno, and so shall we.', 'The epicurean aspect of Campania is encouraging today.', &quot;A decade or so hack, when we spent more than a year in this area, subsisting on army rations highlighted by peanut butter, powdered eggs and chipped beef, the gentle art of gastronomy was in total eclipse, especially among the luckless ranks of the civilians. With memories of a pathetic population living on a diet of greens and a little fruit, of flour and olive oil which could only be bought at outrageous prices on the black market, we found it heartening to observe this fertile countryside today, producing the good things of life in abundance-melons, figs, oranges, lemons, wine, cheese, sausage and, above all, a riotous plenty of vegetables. Hard work and abundant sunshine have replenished the larder and filled out the Neapolitan waistline. The shops are crammed with food now, their ceilings dangling with tight-laced sausages and Provolone cheeses, their shelves laden with the things they love best-black olives, anchovies, tomato paste, artichokes, and the famous pasta which is the backbone of Neapolitan nourishment. The sea is generous too, and the wide marble slabs in fish stores are bedecked with a glittering miscellany of recumbent squids, octupuses, eels, mussels and lobsters: The zealous gastronome who ventures out to the phantasmagorian fish market under immense umbrellas at the Porta Capuana will be richly rewarded. Finally, there is a morose, long-horned bovine munching away in neighboring flats and marshes who contributes a vital element to Neapolitan well-being. She is the  bufala,  and her milk makes possible Mozzarella cheese, the vital ingredient in  pizza  and many another local specialty. A water buffalo sounds like a dubious source of epicurean felicity, but don't be deceived. The best ice cream in the world, in the opinion of many travelers, is found in Groppi's in Cairo, and it is all derived from the same solemn critter.&quot;, &quot;To the average American at home, \xe2\x80\x9cItalian\xe2\x80\x9d cooking means Neapolitan cooking, for this is what has been exported to every corner of the United Slates by Pietro, Luigi, Giuseppe and Enrico. The  minestrone,  the  pizza  and the spaghetti which we are accustomed to find at Tony's on North Main Street, have their original models in D'Angelo and Zi Teresa in Naples.&quot;]</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy: Tuscany</title>
      <url>['It is difficult to avoid a torrent of superlatives in appraising Tuscany and her contribution to the culture and beauty of this world. The list of her famous sons is even now electrifying, centuries after they were horn. How much richer is mankind for the genius of Dante, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, to consider only the pinnacle of human achievement. They all belonged to Tuscany, as did Galileo, the mathematician, Boccaccio, the father of Italian prose-and the racy yarn, and Machiavelli, the unscrupulous statesman whose name has become a synonym for sly plotting and malevolent schemes.', 'Tuscan painters and sculptors have no peers in the realm of art. From Giotto, Fra Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, the della Rohbias and Donatello to the boastful Benvenuto Cellini, the majesty of Florentine genius remains unrivaled, and puts the earthy, camera-toting twentieth-century traveler in  a  mood of awe and wonder. Confronted with such splendors of the past, the mere needs of the present seem insignificant. How does one dare think of food? Why not live on ambrosia and a still life in the Pitti Palace?', &quot;Today's very finite visitor, however, is obliged to come down to earth every few hours, if only because his rebellious feet remind him that he can look at pictures in the Uffizi Gallery just so long, and no longer. The normal desire to sit down and relax must have its turn. Only because such mundane phenomena as thirst and hunger unfailingly assert themselves do we come to the relatively minor art of Tuscan food. True to Tuscan supremacy, it is probably the noblest in Italy. And if this art failed to produce culinary geniuses on the lofty plane of a Dante or a da Vinci, it has the distinction of being the most ancient in Europe. It dates from Etruscan times, a full millennium before the Christian era.&quot;, &quot;This is admittedly a remote boast. Florentine gastronomy can claim another honor which comes right down to the present: It was the forerunner of French cuisine as we know it today. It was Catherine de' Medici, a Florentine name deeply etched in French history, who started a new era of French cooking. When she became the wife of Henry II and Queen of France, she brought her own Italian cooks with her. Their new culinary techniques, their sauces and their sweets, revolutionized court dinners and launched a wonderful new trend. French ingenuity has done the rest down through the ensuing centuries.&quot;, &quot;Tuscany, whose name is derived from its ancient Etruscan origin, is one of the larger Italian regions, containing ten smaller provinces. It has a long coast line along the Mediterranean, and includes the Isle of Elba, made famous by Napoleon's enforced stay. Aside from the flat valley of the Amo, most of Tuscany is either hilly or mount a if urns. The higher stretches of the Apennines can be grim, as veterans of the Fifth Army who spent the winter on Futa Pass can tell you. But most of this region is picture-book stuff-bills carpeted with olive trees and umbrella pines and crowned with regiments of solemn cypresses, villas with wide roofs and formal gardens, fortified hill towns, remort monasteries. Its scacoast is seductive to the vacationist, particularly in the region of Viareggio. But its cities, in the long run, exert the strongest appeal upon travelers. Florence, Pisa, Siena. Lucca, Pistoia, Arezzo-these and a dozen smaller cities have for centuries fascinated visitors, especially the Anglo Saxons. Some of these have been famous-Lord Byron, Keats and Shelley, for example. Robert and Elizabeth Browning could nor be separated from Florence, once they came to know it. Many another English expatriate feels the same way. coming there for a week and remaining a lifetime.&quot;, 'The charm of Tuscan speech and manners has much to do with the popularity of this district. There are laughter and animation and industry here, and, if there is less singing of operatic arias in the local streets than in Naples, the penpie are unfailingly gay and gracious. This is a stronghold of Italian arts and crafts, and few places produce as many interesting things to buy for your friends back home. The shops have an intoxicating effect upon the wide-eyed visitor, and especially upon his wife. What skilled Florentine workmen can do with leather, silver, gold, precious and semiprecious stones, colored marble and silk, is almost beyond belief.', &quot;The keynote of Tuscan gastronomy is furnished by the fertile hillsides, tapestried with the good things of life: olive trees, vineyards, green gardens, and pastures dinted with plump young cattle. The ancient culinary maxim that the best dishes are often the simplest couldn't claim better proof than in Tuscany. Taking advantage of the excellence of his own meats, vegetables, fruit, oil, and the soul-warming wines of Tuscany, the famous Chiauti, the good Tuscan chef presents them with simplicity and good taste-and a minimum of manipulation. There are a few succulent specialties, however, especially in the field of pastry, where the city of Siena has produced delicacies prized all over Italy.&quot;, 'The most celebrated meat dish of Tuscany is  bistecca alla fiorenlina:  a junior size steak broiled only with olive oil, salt and pepper, and served with a quarter of lemon. It is good young Tuscan beef, somewhat sophomoric in comparison to the ponderous steer one encounters in Midwest county fairs. A Florentine beefsteak falls somewhere between a porterhouse and a veal chop, but is much closer to the latter.', &quot;The Florentine variant of the famous Italian dish  fritto misto  contains sweet breads, calf's brains, sliced artichoke, zucchini and small cutlets of lamb, all dipped in flour and beaten egg, and deep-fried in Tuscan olive oil. Fragrant and surprisingly light, this dish goes well with a cool white Chianti. Some restaurants add a few sweet fruit fritters-apple, apricot or orange-thus obviating the need for a dessert course.&quot;, 'Enthusiasts of tripe-an excellent but unloved-by-many dish-will find that young Italian tripe needs less aromatic disguise than  tripe d   la mode de Caen. Trippa alia fiorenlina  is thinly sliced, cooked lung hours in a casserole with meat gravy and tomato. Usually it is served with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese and with white Tuscan beans.']</url>

      <title>A Gastronomic Tour of Italy</title>
      <url>['There are, needless to say, several ways to approach Italy with taste buds atingle. An ocean liner will land the inquiring gourmet within a three-minute walk of a fragrant Neapolitan  pizza  or the most subtle of Genoese raviioli. Stepping off a plane, another questing voluptuary finds himself only a bus ride away from the fastidious restaurants of Rome, Milan, Florence or Bologna. Trains, express autocars and gondolas will take him to less attainable cities. Then again, he may approach this fair peninsula by car, through difficult Alpine passes or by way of the Riviera. This gustatory expedition, soft, sun seeking Sybarites that we are, has chosen the latter approach. It is far from original, but we are confident that the climate, the gaiety and, above all, the culinary charm of Liguria will justify the choice in your eyes.', &quot;Back in the dim chapters of history, Gauls, Romans and Franks have controlled this iridescent ribbon of shore. In the Middle Ages, it belonged to Genoa, and it seesawed back and forth until, at the dawn of the nineteenth century, it became a part of Piedmont. Following the treaty of 1860, which ceded Nice to France, the narrow strip of land which tumbles into the Mediterranean from the watersheds of the Alps is now equally shared by the two adjoining countries. At first sight, Prance seems to have the best of the bargain, at least from the viewpoint of sophistication. Cannes or Cap d'Antibes can be dazzling at first sight! But the Italian Riviera has an intriguing simplicity which comes as something of a relief. After the endless repetition of French perfume shops, lottery booths, candied fruits and jewelry stores, how bereft of artifice are the first few miles of Italy!&quot;, &quot;Here, beyond a doubt, is a hard working elbow of the Azure Coast, where the husky, hill climbing  paesano  has to labor long to make a livelihood from his terraces of chrysanthemums, oranges and carnations. This impression of toiling thrift is heightened by the appearance of donkeys, heavy laden with casks of wine or olive oil, and by straight backed women carrying jugs and bundles on their heads. How quiet and primitive it all seems, you say to yourself. But even as you approach Bodighera, for generations the winter refuge of fog fleeing Londoners, things begin to seem less restful. There is something vaguely nerve shattering in the atmosphere. It doesn't remain vague for long, however. Two new and disquieting factors have arrived to lend a staccato pulse to postwar Italy. One is the repetitious, impact type roadside advertising, which we'll try to discuss later when our power of invective has become a little more acid. The other is the locust plague of \xe2\x80\x9cscooters, \xe2\x80\x9d a word which is now admitted freely into all Latin languages. This fat wheeled little monster has developed to such a point of efficiency and adroitness that owning one is the cherished dream of every Italian youth.&quot;, 'By the time you arrive in San Remo, glistening with luxurious hotels and a naughty looking casino, it is clear that first impressions can be wrong. There is more play than toil along this sunny shore, especially in summer. The Italian Riviera is quite as dedicated to the business of attracting travelers to its hotels as to growing flowers, squeezing olive oil or building ships. Aware of the phenomenal percentage of warm, sunny days throughout the year, a rate of foreign exchange which greatly favors the visitors, and a shore line which in places is supremely beautiful, it is not surprising that the tourist responds to the siren call. It is gratifying to report at first hand that the exacting gourmet interested in regional cookery and wines will encounter rewarding adventures in Liguria and, for that matter, in almost all of the Italian regions. Local wines and dishes have the same charm and variety as they do in France.', &quot;Before we take you for a brief tour of this fragrant coast line, a preview of its epicurean resources might be welcome. A mere glance at these immense mountainsides carpeted with olive trees reveals Liguria's first treasure: the clear, appetizing olive oil which is used in almost all Genoese cooking. A cow would have to be an acrobat to exist on these rocky slopes, and even goats are sparse. No need, therefore, to look too far for local cheeses. For generations Italian farmers have built up stone terraces on these sun soaked hills. By dint of hard labor they have made them productive, aided by concrete water tanks high above them. Fruit trees, flowers and vegetables are box holders in these fertile balconies facing southward to the sea. The citrus family is there in full force oranges, lemons, tangerines and grapefruit but figs, pears, persimmons, peaches, strawberries and table grapes do equally well. So  do  vegetables, particularly artichokes, asparagus, tear shaped little tomatoes and long white radishes which have to be cooked to be palatable. One herb sprouts in unrivaled splendor here basil, the key aroma to Genoese cooking. Higher up in the mountains are orange roofed mushrooms, pine nuts for the asking and a rich yield of chestnuts.&quot;]</url>
